# Object-Detection-Tensorflow-API
The TensorFlow2_Object_Detection Tutorial notebook is perfectly designed for using it in colab.

## Dataset Preparation
You can prepare the dataset using the files in Preparing Dataset directory in utils or you can use the Roboflow website instead for preparing it automatically. (See the instructions in the website)

## Loading Model and Predicting
You can load the trained model and predict it for images and web live detection using the files in Testing and Predicting directory in utils or you can just use the codes in notebook to predict the image you want.
